# Netflix clone build using Reactjs

I replicated the streaming platform netflix using reactjs. I used firebase for user authentication and I also used run payment extention powered by stripe for subscrition base payment modal. I integrated TMDB API which enriches the platform with an extensive catalog of movies and TV shows.

This project has allowed me to refine my ReactJS skills and become proficient in Firebase backend services, user authentication, Stripe integration, and external API utilization.
